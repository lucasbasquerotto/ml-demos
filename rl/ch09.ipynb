    "### Exercise 9.1\n",

    "**Q**\n",
    "\n",
    "Show that tabular methods such as presented in Part I of this book are a special case of linear function approximation. What would the feature vectors be?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the equation 9.15:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{w}_{t+n} \\doteq \\textbf{w}_{t+n-1} + \\alpha [G_{t:t+n} - \\widehat{v}(S_t, \\textbf{w}_{t+n-1})] \\nabla \\widehat{v}(S_t, \\textbf{w}_{t+n-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding equation of the tabular method updates the state-values, and the transformation function also returns the values of each state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{t+n}(S_t) \\doteq V_{t+n-1}(S_t) + \\alpha [G_{t:t+n} - V_{t+n-1}(S_t)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that this is a special case of $\\textbf{w}$ having exactly $|S|$ elements, and each element is equal to the corresponding state-value, that is, $V(s) = \\textbf{w}_s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the feature vectors are $[V(s_0), V(s_1), ..., V(s_{|S| - 1})] = V$, that is, $\\textbf{w} = V$. The feature vectors is the state-values vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to consider the vector of weights $\\textbf{w}$ as the vector of state-values, choose a transformation function that receives a state as input and gives the state-value of that state as output, so $\\widehat{v}(S_t, \\textbf{w}) = V(S_t)$, and the only state-value updated in time step $t$ must be the $V(S_t)$; this can be guaranteed if $\\nabla \\widehat{v}(S_t, \\textbf{w}_{t+n-1})$ is a vector with value 1 at the element corresponding to the state $S_t$, and 0 for all other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize the tabular update to the function approximation update, we can simply consider that the transformation function, $\\widehat{v}$, returns the state-value of the given state, so we just make the transformation for the *k*th state define a vector with the element at that state as 1 and 0 otherwise, which is the same as multiply the *k*th row of the identity matrix ($|S| \\times |S|$), let's call it $I_k$, against $\\textbf{w}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\widehat{v}(s_k, \\textbf{w}) = I_k \\times \\textbf{w} = w_k\n",
    "$$\n",

    "or more generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\widehat{v} = I \\times \\textbf{w} = \\textbf{w}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind that the weight $w_k$ depends only on $s_k$ (that is, it corresponds to a different and single state, because each weight is the state-value of the corresponding state), which means that $\\frac{\\partial \\textbf{w}_a}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_b} = 1$ if $a = b$ and $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla \\widehat{v}(s_k, \\textbf{w}) = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{v}(s_k, \\textbf{w})}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_0}, ..., \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{v}(s_k, \\textbf{w})}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_k}, ..., \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{v}(s_k, \\textbf{w})}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_{|S| - 1}} \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\textbf{w}_k}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_0}, ..., \\frac{\\partial \\textbf{w}_k}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_k}, ..., \\frac{\\partial \\textbf{w}_k}{\\partial \\textbf{w}_{|S| - 1}} \\right] = \\left[ 0, ..., 1, ..., 0 \\right] = I_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $V_t$ be the vector of the state-values at the time-step $t$, the state $S_t$ be the *k*th state $s_k$ ($0 \\leq k \\leq |S| - 1$) and $\\textbf{w}_{k|t}$ be the corresponding weight (state-value in this case) of $s_k$ at the time-step $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the above considerations to the first equation, we get its more specific form as the second equation:\n",

    "The above update changes only the value of the *k*th state, because $I_k$ have value 1 at the *k*th element, and all other elements are 0, so it can ve represented as:\n",

    "with the only change being in the *k*th state, which can be generalised to any state (*k* is just to identify the index of the state $S_t$).\n",
