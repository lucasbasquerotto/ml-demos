    "### Exercise 5.7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**\n",
    "\n",
    "In learning curves such as those shown in Figure 5.3 error generally decreases with training, as indeed happened for the ordinary importance-sampling method. But for the weighted importance-sampling method error first increased and then decreased. Why do you think this happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**\n",
    "\n",
    "As defined in the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dealer is showing a deuce.\n",
    "- The sum of the player's card is 13.\n",
    "- The player has a usable ace.\n",
    "- The target policy is to stick only on a sum of 20 or 21.\n",
    "- The behavior policy is to choose to hit or stick randomly.\n",
    "- The error for each amount of episodes is averaged among 100 independent runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An increased mean squared error means that the calculated value for the state was more distant from the target. In this state, we have an ace, which is expected to show different behaviors depending on whether you reach 20/21 and stop, or exceed, changing the value of the ace from 11 to 1 and trying to reach 20/21 again, which can be seen as a 2nd chance to reach the expected sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values are estimated from the behavior policy, scaling the returns by the importance-sampling ratio ($\\rho$), and then dividing by the sum of the ratios (weighted average). Because the target policy only accepts time-steps that ends in 20 or 21 (stopping when reaching any of these states), or exceeds (because the new card value makes the sum exceed 21), all other cases are dismissed (the ratio is 0). Also, the target policy is deterministic ($\\pi(hit|s) = 1$ when $sum < 20$, $\\pi(stick|s) = 1$ when $20 <= sum$) while the behavior policy for $n-1$ hits and 1 stick (ending the episode), or n hits, exceeding 21 and losing, has n time-steps and has a probability of happening equal to $2^{-n}$, because it's a random policy with 2 actions, so $b(a|s) = 0.5$ for any $a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s) = \\{hit, stick\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that for a higher amount of hits, the probability of the random policy actually executing those actions reduces exponentially, maybe requiring the completion of a huge number of episodes to simulate one such case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given state, the player has an ace, but the number of time-steps to end the episode when 20 or 21 is reached directly is smaller than the number of time-steps if it's exceeded and the ace has its value changed to 1, trying again and reaching 20 or 21, or exceeding 21 and losing. The cases in which the player loses will, on average, have more time-steps (due to more hits). It's possible that many (or even all) among the 100 independent runs of the episodes in the first attempts never reach the case in which the player loses, choosing to stick before (even in cases in which the player has sum less than 20, which will be ignored in the ratio), or exceeds 21 after the player reaches 20 or 21 (in which it would have stopped in the target policy, so not considered in the ratio), making the state have a value higher than it should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "It eventually converges in the expected value as more episodes are completed, and more runs have cases in which the player loses that can happen in the target policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that cases in which the player exceeds 21 will have a much lower probability of happening than cases in which the player sticks to 20/21 using the behavior (random) policy, and because the probability for the target policy will be 1 (in the valid cases in which 20 or 21 was not reached in some previous step), the value of $\\rho$ will be higher, giving more weight to these cases, evetually compensating the lower frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* It's also possible that the behavior policy never reaches 20/21 in the first episodes, which would also influence the target policy value (it would be 0, because no sequence of actions across all runs using the behavior policy are possible under the target policy). Actually, this can happen for any initial states, even those without a usable ace. That said, considering that it's done an average across 100 independent runs, and reaching 20/21 can be done in very few steps, it's more likely to be the first case provided in this answer (there are no case in which the player exceeds 21, but there are cases in which the player stops at 20/21)."
