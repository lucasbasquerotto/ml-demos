Too few states might make several episodes have less than n steps for and an n-step TD, in which case a k-step TD would provide the same result, for k being the number of the time-steps of the episode (k < n in these cases). More states would make the probability of having more time-steps higher, which would create a more adequate scenario to compare n-steps TD for different values of n. With less states, the best value of n should decrease as well.\n",

    "Giving a value of -1 to the leftmost state shouldn't have a significant impact. It could speed up the initial iterations, tough, if the values started with 0, instead of 0.5 (because receiving a reward of -1 when reaching the leftmost state would decrease its value even when the value was not changed before). In the proposed scenario, tough, it should not have a great impact."
