    "# Simple Yet Effective Halite Bot Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below outlines a basic yet functional strategy for a Halite game bot. While it may not represent the pinnacle of strategic complexity or optimization (you can see more powerful implementations in some of the notebooks provided by other kagglers), it embodies a straightforward approach to navigating the game's challenges. The simplicity of the implementation makes it accessible and easy to understand, serving as a solid foundation for further enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, my purpose with this notebook was to have a solid yet simple approach for this challenge (even tough the competition is not open anymore).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Necessary Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins by importing essential functions from the Halite game environment and other standard libraries such as random and math.\n",
    "\n",
    "I avoided more specific and complex libraries to keep the code simple and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple debugging mechanism is established through a DEBUG flag and a debug function. This setup allows for conditional printing of debug information, aiding in the development and troubleshooting process without cluttering the output during normal execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ship Management Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max_ships_steps` list outlines a dynamic ship management strategy, adjusting the maximum number of ships based on the game's progress. This adaptive approach considers both the game's duration and the board size, aiming to optimize the fleet size for different stages of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target positions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `positions_to_go` dictionary is used to map ships to their target positions. This is not kept in the agent function so that the data kept in it can be persisted during several turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of its uses and functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tracking Movement: It keeps track of where each ship is supposed to go. By associating each ship with a position, the algorithm can easily determine the next move for each ship. The implementation was done to allow defining a position to a ship only if there's no ship going to this position yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turn-based Updates: The positions are maintained over several turns, and ships move towards their target positions incrementally. After each turn, the ships' positions are updated based on their current location and their target destination in positions_to_go.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic Updates: The dictionary is updated dynamically. If a ship reaches its target position, the corresponding entry is removed. Similarly, if a ship is destroyed or removed from the game, its entry is removed from the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's no available direction that the ship can go to stay closer to the target position (due to other ships, shipyards or enemies), the ship will try to define and go to another position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent function is designed to generate commands for ships and shipyards in a game environment, based on the current game observation (obs) and game configuration (config). Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens inside the agent function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize Game Board: It creates a Board object using the current game observation and configuration. This object represents the game state, including all ships, shipyards, and their positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Player Identification: It identifies the current player (`me`) by accessing `board.current_player`. This is used to make decisions specific to the player's assets (ships and shipyards).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Max Ships Calculation: It calculates the maximum number of ships (`max_ships`) the player should aim for. This is based on a multiplier (`max_ships_mult`) determined by the current game step compared to predefined steps and multipliers in `max_ships_steps`. The idea is to dynamically adjust the target number of ships as the game progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Min Shipyards Calculation: It calculates the minimum number of shipyards (`min_shipyards`) the player should maintain. This is based on the current number of ships, aiming to keep shipyards as 1/4 of the number of ships, with at least one shipyard as long as there is at least one ship (to convert).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Halite Management: It determines the minimum halite (`halite_min`) to keep when spawning a ship. This threshold is adjusted based on the number of ships the player has, encouraging more conservative halite spending as the player's fleet grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* End Game Detection: It checks if the game is close to ending (`close_to_end`) or is in the final steps (`ending`), based on the current game step. This can influence more aggressive or conservative strategies as the game wraps up (when the game is close to end, the ships will try to deposit in shipyards, or convert).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Movement Tracking: It initializes lists to track positions ships will move to (`positions_moved_to`) and from (`positions_moved_from`) during this turn. This helps in avoiding collisions and managing ship movements efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shipyards and Enemy Tracking: It compiles lists of the player's shipyard positions (`my_shipyards_positions`) and identifies enemy ships (`enemy_ships`) and shipyards (`enemy_shipyards`). This information is useful to determine where the ship can or can't go (`allowed_positions` and `allowed_directions`) and also if the ship shouldn't stay where it is (`should_move`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent function then proceeds with the following main steps, in this order, for ship management:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ship Conversion: It converts ships to shipyards if the number of shipyards is less than the minimum expected. This prioritizes converting ships that are far from existing shipyards and have sufficient halite to convert and spawn a new ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ship Spawning: It spawns new ships from existing shipyards if the number of ships is less than the minimum expected. This prioritizes spawning ships that are far from existing ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deposit Halite: It checks if the ship should deposit halite in a shipyard based on the cargo size and proximity to the closest shipyard. This is important to prevent losing halite to enemy ships and to ensure efficient resource collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each ship, it determines the allowed directions based on the neighboring cells' positions and the positions to avoid (enemy ships with less halite, shipyards, and other ships' positions, including possible positions that enemy ships can move to). The ship will try to choose one of the following actions, in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Ship Movement: If there's already a position defined for the ship, the ship will try to go in this direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If the ship should move (due to enemy presence) or should go collect more (due to low halite in the cell), it will try to find a cell with more halite to collect, or a close shipyard to deposit the cargo (it defines where to go based on the amount of halite per step of each possible action). In this case, the position is persisted across turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If no direction was defined in the previous conditions, and the ship should move and has at least 1 direction that it can go, it will move randomly.\n",
